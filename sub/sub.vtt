00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.504
Okay, okay. Here we go.

2
00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.460
So lonely.

3
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:23.830
Stiff.

4
00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.460
I can't do that!

5
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.966
Come on, Elsa, this is for Anna.
You can do this.

6
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:32.800
Relax! It looks great.

7
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.950
I just want it to be perfect.

8
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.570
Speaking of perfect, check this out.

9
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.810
Kristoff, are you sure I can
leave you in charge here?

10
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:44.860
Absolutely.

11
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.650
Because I don't want anything
to happen to this courtyard.

12
00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.108
What could happen? It's all set.

13
00:00:50.208 --> 00:00:52.442
Olaf, what are you doing?

14
00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:54.411
I'm not eating cake.

15
00:00:54.611 --> 00:00:57.850
- Olaf...
- But it's an ice cream cake!

16
00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.717
- And it's for Anna.
- And it's for Anna.

17
00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.269
- Oh, it's time!
- It's time! For what?

18
00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:08.870
Okay...

19
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.710
- You sure you got this?
- I'm sure.

20
00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.973
- Don't let anyone in before we're ready.
- I won't.

21
00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:15.380
- And don't touch anything.
- I'm just gonna stand here.

22
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.769
- I'm probably gonna walk around a little.
- And keep an eye on that cake!

23
00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.135
She thinks you're an idiot!

24
00:01:23.235 --> 00:01:25.970
Well, clearly she's wrong!

25
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.060
- What? It's fine.
- I can't read... or spell.

26
00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.580
- Anna!
- Yeah?

27
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.770
Happy birthday.

28
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.520
To you.

29
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.720
It's your birthday!

30
00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.290
To me...

31
00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.100
- It's my birthday.
- Come on!

32
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.770
- It's my birthday?
- And it's going to be perfect because...

33
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.300
<i>You've never had a real birthday before</i>

34
00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.370
<i>Except, of course, the ones
just spent outside my locked door</i>

35
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.343
<i>So I'm here way too late
to help you celebrate.</i>

36
00:02:05.443 --> 00:02:09.160
<i>And be your birthday date if I may...</i>

37
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.270
<i>Elsa, I'm thinking you might have a cold</i>

38
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.540
I don't get colds, besides...

39
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.810
<i>A cold never bothered me anyway</i>

40
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.790
- Fancy.
- Just follow the string.

41
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.255
Wait, what?

42
00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.210
<i>I've got big plans,
I've got surprises for today</i>

43
00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.640
<i>Nothing but nothing's
gonna get in our way</i>

44
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.080
<i>I've worked for weeks
planned everything within my power</i>

45
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.350
<i>I even got Kristoff and Sven
to take shower</i>

46
00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.804
<i>If someone wants to hold me back</i>

47
00:02:52.904 --> 00:02:57.050
- <i>I'd like to see them try</i>
- Summer!

48
00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.980
<i>I'm on the birthday plan attack</i>

49
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.090
<i>I'm giving you the sun,
the moon and the sky</i>

50
00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.740
Little brothers!

51
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.790
- <i>I'm making today a perfect day for you</i>
- Sandwich!

52
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.900
<i>I'm making today a blast
if it's the last thing I do</i>

53
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.810
<i>For everything you are to me
and all you've been through</i>

54
00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.998
<i>I'm making today a perfect day for you</i>

55
00:03:31.584 --> 00:03:34.100
- They come in threes!
- I'm fine.

56
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.381
<i>Surprise, surprise this one specially...</i>

57
00:03:44.481 --> 00:03:47.960
<i>You've got me reeling
but I'm still concerned for you</i>

58
00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.530
<i>I think it's time that you go home
and get some rest</i>

59
00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.770
<i>We are not stopping
'cause the next one is the best</i>

60
00:03:59.763 --> 00:04:03.250
<i>Elsa, you gotta go lie down</i>

61
00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.430
<i>No way, we have to paint the town</i>

62
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.610
<i>But you need medical attention</i>

63
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:15.760
<i>Are you sick? How 'bout a cold remedy
of my own invention</i>

64
00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.780
- No thanks.
- We'll take it.

65
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.999
- <i>We're making today a perfect day for you</i>
- <i>Making today a special day</i>

66
00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:25.100
<i>We're singing a birthday song
to make your wishes come true</i>

67
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.992
- <i>Wishes come true</i>
- <i>We love princess Anna</i>

68
00:04:29.092 --> 00:04:30.661
<i>And I love you too</i>

69
00:04:30.761 --> 00:04:35.168
<i>So we're making today a perfect day
A fabulous day in every way</i>

70
00:04:35.268 --> 00:04:37.418
<i>We're making today a perfect day</i>

71
00:04:37.518 --> 00:04:39.630
I can fix it.

72
00:04:39.937 --> 00:04:41.754
No, no!

73
00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.137
All fixed!

74
00:04:47.237 --> 00:04:49.160
"Dry banana hippy hat"?

75
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.400
Come on. Now we climb!

76
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.950
Elsa, that's too much. You need to rest.

77
00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.880
We need to get to our birthday chills,
I mean thrills.

78
00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.575
<i>Making dreams, making plans</i>

79
00:05:01.775 --> 00:05:04.600
<i>Go, go, go, go!</i>

80
00:05:04.895 --> 00:05:07.910
<i>Follow the string to the end
You are my very best friend</i>

81
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.380
- Elsa?
- What? I'm fine.

82
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.004
<i>We're gonna climb, we're gonna sing</i>

83
00:05:14.104 --> 00:05:17.092
<i>Follow the string to the thing</i>

84
00:05:17.192 --> 00:05:20.028
<i>Happy, happy, happy
Merry, merry, merry</i>

85
00:05:20.228 --> 00:05:23.250
<i>Hot... cold... hot... big day</i>

86
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.050
Elsa, look at you. You've got a fever.
You're burning up.

87
00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.130
<i>Alright, we can't go on like this</i>

88
00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:35.125
<i>Let's put this day on hold</i>

89
00:05:35.225 --> 00:05:39.270
<i>Come on, admit it to yourself</i>

90
00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.245
<i>Okay</i>

91
00:05:41.345 --> 00:05:44.675
<i>I have a cold</i>

92
00:05:45.769 --> 00:05:50.440
I'm sorry, Anna. I just wanted
to give you one perfect birthday,

93
00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.950
but I ruined it. Again.

94
00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.290
You didn't ruin anything.
Let's just get you to bed.

95
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.198
Surprise!

96
00:06:04.388 --> 00:06:08.399
<i>We're making today a perfect day for you</i>

97
00:06:08.499 --> 00:06:12.085
<i>We're making today a smiley face
all shiny and new</i>

98
00:06:12.385 --> 00:06:16.867
- <i>There's a fine line between chaos
- And a hullabaloo</i>

99
00:06:16.967 --> 00:06:20.580
<i>We're making today a perfect day
Making today a perfect day</i>

100
00:06:20.838 --> 00:06:22.800
<i>A! N! N! A!</i>

101
00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.670
- <i>Making today a perfect day for you</i>
- Happy birthday.

102
00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.900
- <i>Making today a happy day and no feeling blue</i>
- I love you baby!

103
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.859
<i>For everything you are to us</i>

104
00:06:32.959 --> 00:06:34.960
- <i>And all that you do</i>
- I do.

105
00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:39.044
<i>We're making today a perfect day
Making today a perfect day</i>

106
00:06:39.144 --> 00:06:41.225
<i>Making today a perfect day</i>

107
00:06:41.325 --> 00:06:43.970
- Perfect day!
- Okay. To bed with you.

108
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:47.680
Wait, wait. All that's left to do is for
the queen to blow the birthday bugle horn.

109
00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:49.833
No, no, no, no, no...

110
00:06:59.503 --> 00:07:02.780
- Best birthday present ever.
- Which one?

111
00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.460
You letting me take care of you.

112
00:07:15.475 --> 00:07:18.668
This way, Sludge and Slush and Slide
and Ansel and Flake and Fridge

113
00:07:18.768 --> 00:07:22.619
and Flurry and Powder and Crystal
and Squall and Pack and Sphere

114
00:07:22.719 --> 00:07:26.080
- and William!
- Don't ask.

115
