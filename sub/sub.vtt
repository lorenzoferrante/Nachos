<i>There used to be more of them,

It was before wizards went underground,

Young wizards and witches

<i>So, instead of learning to harness
or to control their powers,</i>

909
01:04:25.988 --> 01:04:28.950
they developed
what was called an Obscurus.

910
01:04:31.827 --> 01:04:34.163
It's an unstable,
uncontrollable dark force

Mr. Graves.

931
01:06:39.664 --> 01:06:42.583
You were thrown out of Hogwarts

- That was an accident.
- With a beast.

Yet one of your teachers argued strongly
against your expulsion.

Now,

I really couldn't say.

938
01:07:03.854 --> 01:07:06.941
So setting a pack
of dangerous creatures loose here was

939
01:07:10.403 --> 01:07:12.905
just another accident. Is that right?

940
01:07:13.864 --> 01:07:15.104
Why would I do it deliberately?

941
01:07:15.241 --> 01:07:17.243
To expose wizardkind.

942
01:07:18.202 --> 01:07:21.122
To provoke war between
the magical and non-magical worlds.

Mass slaughter
for the greater good, you mean?

01:07:27.461 --> 01:07:28.462
Yes.

It's an Obscurus.

But it's not what you think.

950
01:08:01.328 --> 01:08:03.247
I managed to separate it
from the Sudanese girl

<i>as I tried to save her.</i>

<i>So I wanted to take it home to study it.</i>

You fool nobody, Mr. Scamander.

You know that can't hurt anyone.
You know that.

You are therefore guilty of
